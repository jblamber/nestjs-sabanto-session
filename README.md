# Welcome to the Sabanto NestJS Coding Session!

We will start small and work our way up! Take a breath, relax!

## Exercise One

In `app.service.ts` there is an unimplemented method to generate fibonnaci sequences. Write a small function to generate fibbonacci numbers and write one associated unit test (in the .spec.js file)

## Exercise Two

See:
--https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs-addons/in-memory-db
Make a new service, or method in an existing service to retrieve a user based on an id

## Exercise Three

Given the following domain model:

- organization has many users
- organization has many tractors
- a user can control any tractor in their organization

Update the entities in the model to match this, make a new service, or method in an existing service to get a list of tractors that are available to be controlled by a given user id
